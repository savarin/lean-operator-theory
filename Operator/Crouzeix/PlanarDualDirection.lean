# Real dual directions in the complex plane

Every real continuous linear functional on `ℂ` is a dot product with a
unique planar coefficient vector.  A nonzero functional is therefore a
positive multiple of the unit directional functional indexed by the
argument of that coefficient vector.  This elementary identification lets
abstract separating hyperplanes be converted to the angle-indexed support
halfspaces used by the smooth support-curve construction.
