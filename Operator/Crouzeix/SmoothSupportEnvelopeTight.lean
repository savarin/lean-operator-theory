# Arbitrarily tight rounded support envelopes

The quantitative support-envelope estimate becomes an arbitrary open
neighborhood estimate after choosing the smoothing and rounding scales.  We
record an explicit choice that remains valid even for one-point finite sets,
where the logarithmic cardinality term vanishes.

of that envelope stays in a prescribed metric thickening. -/
